# Overview
Here are my personal lecture notes and cheat sheet for Course: _Algebra and Computation_, which is a course offered to Freshman students at Yao Class. 

This course mainly discusses some advanced topics in TCS that combines group theory and algebra. Namely, some of the topics are:
- Group-theoretic algorithms for Graph Isomorphism
- Algebraic Algorithms for Perfect Matchings

This is one of the rare courses that combines usefulness (i.e. I really gained a lot from this course), fun (i.e. The lectures are well-organized and the content is interesting), and depth (i.e. heavy math, rigorous proofs and deep insights). It's grading policy is also very lenient, and I got an A+ with perfect raw score. I highly recommend this course to everyone.

Hope you enjoy it!
